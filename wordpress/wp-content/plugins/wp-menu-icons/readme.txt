WP Menu Icons allows you to add icons to your items WordPress menu.

== Description ==
[Documentation](https://quadlayers.com/portfolio/wp-menu-icons/) | [QuadMenu](https://wordpress.org/plugins/quadmenu) | [Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/quadlayers/)

The menu of the site can be so simplest as a list of links without indentation or the complex place in a site.

But most developers fight to provide more complex and more features in their mega menu plugins and forgot about the users that only need a very simple function that doesn't come in the default WordPress menu.

That's the reason why we've created WP Menu Icons, a plugin that doesn't presume to be the best WordPress Mega Menu plugin, but does what it has to do: gives you the ability to include icons into your WordPress menu.
